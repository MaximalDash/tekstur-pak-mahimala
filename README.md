a dumb ass stupid gd resource pack with a ton of dumb ass stupid stuff

I created this texture pack purely because i wanted my gd to look as goofy as possible, lots of stuff is written on russian language (because it's my native language and it's easier for me to come up with some silly phrases) and also it contains swear words and slurs, just for the sake of fun, so deal with it. Anyways, thanks for downloading my texture pack, enjoy :)
