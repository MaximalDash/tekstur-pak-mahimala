a dumb ass stupid gd resource pack with a ton of dumb ass stupid stuff

I created this texture pack because i wanted my gd to look as goofy as possible, lots of stuff is written on russian language (because it's my native language and it's easier for me to come up with some silly phrases) and also it contains swear words, so you have to deal with it. Anyways, thanks for downloading my texture pack, enjoy :)

Also you may want to download the happy textures mod for this tp to work correctly, or else dialogues will be broken, there won't be any custom bgs at vaults and no use for the more games button, which is very important...
